-Builtins are not dependent on PATH, but can they be hardcoded,
i.e. 
    char *args[] = {"echo", "hello", NULL};
	if (execv("/usr/bin/echo", args) == 0)
		printf("Problem with execv\n");?
        
    "Your shell must implement the following builtins:
    ◦ echo with option -n
    ◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
    ◦ pwd with no options
    ◦ export with no options
    ◦ unset with no options
    ◦ env with no options or arguments
    ◦ exit with no options"
